He initially advocated for the Nation of Islam's separatist ideology, but later renounced it and adopted a more inclusive, pan-Africanist approach. He famously spoke out against racism, inequality, and police brutality, and his message resonated with many young African Americans at the time.\n\nTragically, Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, but his legacy continues to inspire and influence social justice movements to this day. His autobiography, written with Alex Haley, is a classic of American literature and a powerful testament to his life and struggles."

By following established rules and norms, individuals contribute to a sense of stability and predictability, which is necessary for a functioning society. Moreover, conformity helps to prevent chaos and disorder, allowing people to work together towards common goals.\n\n**Side 2: Independent thinking and nonconformity are essential for progress and innovation**\n\nThis side argues that prioritizing independent decision-making and nonconformity is crucial for driving progress, innovation, and positive change. By questioning and challenging established norms and rules, individuals can bring about necessary reforms, uncover new ideas, and promote critical thinking. Nonconformity also allows individuals to maintain their autonomy and authenticity, rather than merely following the crowd.\n\nThis question and its two sides offer a rich foundation for a persuasive essay, as it touches on fundamental issues related to individuality, community, and social responsibility."
