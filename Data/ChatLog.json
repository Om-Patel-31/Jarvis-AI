Additionally, some of the sentences are quite short and lack context, making it difficult to understand the full picture.\n\nTo improve your notes, I'd suggest trying to organize the ideas into clear sections or categories, and adding more context and explanations to help tie everything together. Additionally, consider using complete sentences and providing more detail to support each point."
